	    <h2>Tanzania - Working Conditions & Life</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
        There are a lot of rural people in Tanzania with very little money.  They may work part time or for very little money. People seem to move to more urban areas. Despite the large numbers of poor, they are increasing by new births of children at a high rate.  There were 45 million people in Tanzania in 2012 and estimated to be around 59 million in 2019. 
        </p>

            Dar es Salam, the city pictured above (page 2), is where the people, especially the young people, go to find work.  Dar es Salaam means "House of Peace" (Arabic).   It is Tanzania's most prominent city in arts, fashion, media, music, film and television and is a leading financial center.  The city is the leading arrival and departure point for most tourists who visit Tanzania, Africa; including national parks for safaris and the Islands of Unguja and Pemba. Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. It contains high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of Tanzania, which has 88% of its population in rural areas.  Downtown includes small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated from the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent areas of the world.
